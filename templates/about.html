  <div><p style="padding: 1vw;">CodeHunter was started in 2021 as an educational initiative for the programming community by Directi, an Indian software products company. Today, CodeHunter is one of the world’s largest and popular global competitive programming platforms preferred by student & professional programmers. In 2021, CodeHunter was added under the aegis of the Unacademy brand.<br> 

    CodeHunter promotes constant learning and friendly programming competitions for its users, along with the support of its large community of problem curators.<br>
    
    CodeHunter was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms, computer programming, and programming contests. It hosts three featured contests every month (Long Challenge, CookOff, LunchTime & Starters) and gives away prizes and goodies to the winners as encouragement. Apart from these, the platform is also open to the entire programming community, especially academic institutes, and student bodies, to host their own contests. Major institutions & corporates across the globe use CodeHunter’s platform to host their contests, internal & external coding assessments. On average, 30+ external contests are hosted on CodeHunter’s platform every month. <br>
    
    CodeHunter also partners with schools, colleges, and student groups to create local CodeHunter Chapters, meet-ups, orientation sessions & programming workshops. In addition, CodeHunter sponsors coding contests and teams of Indian programmers as part of its Go for Gold Initiative for ICPC & IOI.<br>
    
    SnackDown by CodeHunter is a world-renowned annual programming competition that attracts participation from programmers from 140+ countries.<br>
    
    Very recently, CodeHunter launched its new program - Learn Competitive Programming With CodeHunter - on Unacademy’s robust learning platform. Read more about this launch here.
    <br>
    CodeHunter’s YouTube Channels are also a source of free learning and knowledge for the community with video editorials and recorded problem-solving sessions from top-rated programmers.</p></div> <hr>

        <div class="accordion-body">It was in the year 2009 that CodeHunter was founded in Mumbai, Maharashtra (India). The goal & the discussion point was - How to improve and expand the Indian programming community. This goal was shaped by the following turn of events: <br><br>

          Directi had made its first visit to campus for hiring freshers in the year 2009. It was an active phase in Directi’s history when as an organization, it wanted to make a significant transition. Directi wanted to build some great products, and for that, it wanted to hire the best talent from across the country. It was a big leap for Directi. The only question was how? <br><br>
          
          Key members at Directi were in a discussion and came to know about the ICPC through a few of their lateral hires. The members explored more about ICPC, and it was then that they figured out for the first time the value of competitive programming, also known as Sports Programming. <br><br>
          
          It dawned on the team that there was a direct correlation between the best software engineers and the best competitive programmers. While the team did find a path towards their hunt for the best talent, they realized a bigger problem that India was facing. <br><br>
          
          They came to know how poorly India had been performing at ICPC, the most prestigious international programming event across the globe. In spite of the vast amount of intellectual talent available in the country, India’s performance has not been close to top-notch. It was disheartening to see India lagging behind vis-a-vis other nations when it came to solving complex programming problems. The team launched CodeHunter as an experiment to address this situation. They wanted Indian students to have fun while learning & improving. It was also important for them to bring the global competition home so that Indian students can learn to compete with the best out there. <br><br>
          
          In 2010, CodeHunter launched the Go For Gold program. The goal of the Go for Gold Project is ambitious: CodeHunter wanted an Indian college team to win the ICPC contest, the most competitive programming challenge in the world. In 2013, CodeHunter extended the Go For Gold program to cover the International Olympiad in Informatics for school students. And in the year 2020, the custodianship of CodeHunter was transferred from Directi to Unacademy. <br><br>
          
          <b>More than a million programmers worldwide have joined CodeHunter so far, and we're always looking for more.</b> </div>
